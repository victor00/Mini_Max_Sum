# Mini_Max_Sum
Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.

Explanation

Our initial numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. We can calculate the following sums using four of the five integers:

If we sum everything except 1, our sum is 2+3+4+5 = 14.

If we sum everything except 2, our sum is 1+3+4+5 = 13.

If we sum everything except 3, our sum is 1+2+4+5 = 12.

If we sum everything except 4, our sum is 1+2+3+5 = 11.

If we sum everything except 5, our sum is 1+2+3+4 = 10.
